        The Bitcoin system, protocol and software, is full of features that lie dormant.  They are not used today and
        when I was reimplementing Bitcoin in Java a few years ago, I ran across these features and I asked Satoshi what
        are they for? He responded by giving me some basic training on the design of what he calls contracts and then he
        vanished so the rest we have to figure out ourselves.

        The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow
        transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a
        big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning
        to make sure they would be possible later.
